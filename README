Look at webpage
- Check for new upload. Meetings are timestamped, you should be able to confirm that something is new since the last crontab. Maybe this would be an issue if they post a meeting very late.

- Get upload metadata
There is a <iframe> in the page source that has the master.m3u8 file which has the same URL of the transport stream .ts file

For example:

https://telvuevod-secure.akamaized.net/vodhls/vod_player/249/media/856528/1708567600/master.m3u8

And then an actual .ts file. I will have to learn how to detect the last one
https://telvuevod-secure.akamaized.net/vodhls/vod_player/249/media/856528/1708567600/seg-9-f1-v1-a1.ts

I can pass one of these files to ffmpeg to strip the audio. That's generally helpful:
wget -O- https://telvuevod-secure.akamaized.net/vodhls/vod_player/249/media/856528/1708567600/seg-9-f1-v1-a1.ts | ffmpeg -i - output.mp3

and I can combine multiple files with ffmpeg:
ffmeg -i output.mp3 -i output2.mp3 -filter_complex "[0:a][1:a]concat=n=2:v=0:a=1" combined.mp3

ffmpeg is noisy, there's probably a way to quiet the input.

Eventually we should be able to stream video

Eventually get audio in there
